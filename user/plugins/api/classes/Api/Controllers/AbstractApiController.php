     * Validate only the fields present in `$changes` against their blueprint

     *
     * We validate the submitted delta — NOT the whole merged object — on
     * purpose. Grav's own stock config doesn't pass a whole-object
     * `$blueprint->validate()`: `system.errors.display` ships as a bool against
     * a `type: int` rule, and the core `list` validator rejects complete
     * security/backups/scheduler list items (required per-item sub-fields are
     * checked at the wrong nesting level). All of those landmines live in
     * fields the request never touches, so validating just the changed fields
     * sidesteps them while still rejecting an invalid value or a required field
     * submitted empty (getgrav/grav-plugin-admin2#30). Completeness — a required
     * field the user never filled — is enforced by the admin UI, which renders
     * the whole form.
     *
     * `$changes` is keyed exactly as the blueprint expects (e.g. `errors.display`
     * nested under `errors`, page fields under `header`); it is flattened to the
     * blueprint's leaf fields here.
     *
     * Some clients (notably admin-next's config form) post the WHOLE form rather
     * than just the edited fields. To keep the "validate only what changed"
     * guarantee in that case, pass the persisted `$existing` baseline: any leaf
     * whose submitted value equals the baseline is skipped. Without this, a
     * single pre-existing invalid value — common after a 1.x→2.0 migration —
     * would fail validation on every save and block edits to unrelated fields,
     * even though the user never touched it (getgrav/grav#4176). When `$existing`
     * is empty (other callers that already send a true delta) every submitted
     * leaf is validated, exactly as before.
     *
     * @param array $changes  Incoming values (possibly nested), as sent by the client.
     * @param array $existing Persisted baseline to diff against; [] validates all of $changes.
